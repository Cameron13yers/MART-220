\fs30 This assignment was very similar to the self portrait Homework that we worked on in Creative Coding I. However this time I got to see how an AI would take on the assignment and learn how to roughly start the assignment. It is interesting to see how AI thinks and codes using p5.js. I feel like my representation was a lot better than the AI\'92s simply because I used a lot more shapes and even rotating shapes to create a more detailed look. I was having a bit of trouble figuring out the rotation feature within JavaScript and how to only rotate certain objects and I actually was able to  ChatGPT to figure out a temporary solution to it which helped a lot. Overall I had a pretty fun time getting to create one of my favorite foods using the p5.js skills that I learned within Creative Coding I.}
