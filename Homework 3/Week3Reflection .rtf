\fs30 I had a lot of fun with this week\'92s assignment. Although it was a bit challenging at times, I loved the idea of adding creative movement and interaction to my p5.js art of my favorite food. Originally I didn\'92t have the Bananas on this piece but I felt like it was a perfect addition to have some banana slices bounce around the screen. I also added the ability to click and place on the blueberries yourself. Some of these weeks mechanics took me a while to figure out and took some getting ahead of what we\'92ve been learning, but ultimately ChatGPT was my best friend this week again in terms of figuring out how to incorporate certain ideas into my piece.\

	ChatGPT\'92s version of this week\'92s assignment was very minimal as always but also surprisingly kinda fun. ChatGPT made it to where the blueberries moved around when the cursor moves and also made it to where you can click on the syrup and change it to a random color which I thought was pretty cool. Overall I definitely feel like I still have a pretty big upper hand on ChatGPT when creating this assignment but nonetheless I used a lot of help from ChatGPT in order to figure out how to make things work within p5.js. }
